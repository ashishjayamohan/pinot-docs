# ARRAYLENGTH

Returns the length of a multi-value column

## Signature

> ARRAYLENGTH('colName')

## Usage Examples

These examples are based on the [Hybrid Quick Start](../../basics/getting-started/quick-start.md#hybrid).

```sql
select ARRAYLENGTH(RandomAirports) AS length, count(*) 
from airlineStats 
GROUP BY length
ORDER BY count(*) DESC
LIMIT 5
```

| length | count(\*) |
| ------ | --------- |
| 1      | 5382      |
| 37     | 267       |
| 33     | 223       |
| 17     | 166       |
| 22     | 160       |

{% hint style="info" %}
The `count(*)` values will increase each time we execute the query as data is constantly being ingested by the Hybrid Quick Start.
{% endhint %}
