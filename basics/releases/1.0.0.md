#### Null value support for pinot queries

* NULL support for ORDER BY, DISTINCT, GROUP BY, value transform functions and filtering.

#### Upsert enhancements

**Delete support in upsert enabled tables (**[**#10703**](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/10703)**)**

Support added to extend upserts and allow deleting records from a realtime table. The design details can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19s1AHCRjmqeVa0z\_djYBTAt\_meg6qWcUxwRO3y-G9O4/edit).

**Preload segments with upsert snapshots to speedup table loading (**[**#11020**](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/11020)**)**

Adds a feature to preload segments from a table that uses the upsert snapshot feature. The segments with validDocIds snapshots can be preloaded in a more efficient manner to speed up the table loading (thus server restarts).

#### JSON and CLP encoded message ingestion and querying

* Add clpDecode transform function for decoding CLP-encoded fields. ([#10885](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/10885))
* Add CLPDecodeRewriter to make it easier to call clpDecode with a column-group name rather than the individual columns. ([#11006](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/11006))
* Add SchemaConformingTransformer to transform records with varying keys to fit a table's schema without dropping fields. ([#11210](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/11210))

**Config to use customized broker query thread pool (**[**#10614**](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/10614)**)**

Added new configuration options below which allow use of a bounded thread pool and allocate capacities for it.

```
pinot.broker.enable.bounded.http.async.executor
pinot.broker.http.async.executor.max.pool.size
pinot.broker.http.async.executor.core.pool.size
pinot.broker.http.async.executor.queue.size
```

This feature allows better management of broker resources.

**Drop results support (**[**#10419**](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/10419)**)**

Adds a parameter to queryOptions to drop the resultTable from the response. This mode can be used to troubleshoot a query (which may have sensitive data in the result) using metadata only.

**Make column order deterministic in segment (**[**#10468**](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/10468)**)**

In segment metadata and index map, store columns in alphabetical order so that the result is deterministic. Segments generated before/after this PR will have different CRC, so during the upgrade, we might get segments with different CRC from old and new consuming servers. For the segment consumed during the upgrade, some downloads might be needed.

**Allow configuring helix timeouts for EV dropped in Instance manager (**[**#10510**](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/10510)**)**

Adds options to configure helix timeouts\
`external.view.dropped.max.wait.ms`` - The duration of time in milliseconds to wait for the external view to be dropped. Default - 20 minutes.` external.view.check.interval.ms\`\` - The period in milliseconds in which to ping ZK for latest EV state.

**Enable case insensitivity by default (**[**#10771**](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/10771)**)**

This PR makes Pinot case insensitive be default, and removes the deprecated property enable.case.insensitive.pql

**Newly added APIs and client methods**

* Add Server API to get tenant pools ([#11273](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/11273))
* Add new broker query point for querying multi-stage engine ([#11341](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/11341))

* \[feature] \[backward-incompat] \[null support # 2] Preserve null literal information in literal context and literal transform ([#10380](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/10380))\
  String versions of numerical values are no longer accepted. For example, "123" won't be treated as a numerical anymore.

**Controller job status ZNode path update**

* Moving Zk updates for reload, force\_commit to their own Znodes which â€¦ ([#10451](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/10451))\
  The status of previously completed reload jobs will not be available after this change is deployed.

**Metric names for mutable indexes to change**

* Implement mutable index using index SPI ([#10687](https://github.com/apache/pinot/pull/10687))\
  Due to a change in the IndexType enum used for some logs and metrics in mutable indexes, the metric names may change slightly.
